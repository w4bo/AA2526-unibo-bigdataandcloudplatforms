# Seminar: LAIF

# Considerations

- Nice to see that multidisciplinariety pays out
- Sales man with a tech background is very important
- It is important to have a failure in your background, to know what not to do
- Innovative vs product startup
- For some companies, using Excel is already enough as innovation
- Give yourself time
- TEST. Choose among: lot of money, work-life balance, teamwork, research and learn something new
- Design thinking

# Technical solution

- IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
    - No manual provisioning
    - Faster scalability: everything is parametrized. Changing parameters is easy
    - Reproducibility (e.g., deploy an architecture hundreds of times)
    - Based on cloud formation
- Containers (standard for managing applications)
- Fast APIs

# Questions

- How big is the gap from being mathematician to applied data management
- Why have you chosen AWS?
