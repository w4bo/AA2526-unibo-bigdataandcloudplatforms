- We cannot update/extend the cluster anymore
- What about migrating to the cloud? (we only consider AWS)

# Migration

Moving a Hadoop cluster to the cloud (we only consider AWS)

- [AWS price calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate)

How do we start?

- We have already defined the hardware and the software stack
- Start with coarse tuning, identify the dominating costs first
  - Is it computing, storage, or processing?
- Identify a suitable budget, implement, and refine later
  - Wrong refinements can do a lot of damage

Migrating the cluster as-is: ?

- Hint: add 18 EC2 instances satisfying the hardware requirements

$SOL_{cloud 1}$ migrating the cluster as-is: 13500\$/month = 162000\$/year

- 18 EC2 instances (t4g.2xlarge) with 12TB EBS storage each machine

Prices change over the year

- In 2022, 162000\$/year
- [In 2023](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=7757afffccc3cafdcfdeb212b74623ef02ed5a36), 146000\$/year

Still, we have no software configuration

Pay attention to the region

- Different regions, different prices
- Different regions, different services
- Remember the GDPR and data locality

# Migration

It makes no sense to move the cluster as-is

- More machines ensure better (on-prem) scalability but higher costs

How do we proceed with the migration?

- We need minimum software requirements
- Try to achieve the smallest migration impact
  - Find the most similar cloud-based solution to a Hadoop cluster
  - Rethink applications (later) when you got the know-how
- Identify a suitable budget and refine it later
  - Wrong refinements can do a lot of damage

# Migration

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}

**HDFS**

- How much durability do we need?
  - HP0: three replicas (we stick to this)
  - HP1: decrease replicas for cold data
  - HP2: move cold data to the glacier or delete id
  - ...

**HBase** has marginal effects on the pricing (100GB << 50TB)

- For simplicity, we can omit it

**Overall**: 50TB storage/year

Processing takes place each time that ESA provides a satellite image

- Some days no images are available
- Some days up to 10 images are available
- Spark jobs are always executed with the same parameters

**Image processing**

- 4 machines, 2 cores, 10GB RAM at least

**Weather processing** is negligible

$SOL_{cloud 2}$: compare 4 machines on-premises vs on cloud

- Assuming 1 Executor = 1 Machine

On-premises

- 4 machines: 10602€/year / 18 machines x 4 machines = *2356€/year*
- Cloudera requires at least 10 nodes: *100000€/year*

AWS

- 4 EC2 instances: 162000\$/year / 18 machines x 4 machines = *36000\$/year*
- Problems
  - Machines are up and running even when no computation is necessary
    - This is necessary to persist data
  - Still, no software stack

HDFS on EC2

- Heavy price
- Machine must always be on to guarantee data persistence
- Data locality

S3

- Much cheaper
- Does not require machines for data storage
- Data locality is lost

Migrating cluster to EMR: *?*

Given the software requirements, we need

- 1 x *Master node* (to manage the cluster)
- 1 x *Core node* (with HDFS/EBS)
- 4 x *Task nodes* (to compute)

# Summing up

We estimated the cluster costs

- On-premises solution with 18 machines: no-go
- Cloud solution with 18 EC2 instances: no go

We reduced the solution based on software requirements

- On-premises solution with 4 machines: no-go
- Cloud solution with 4 EC2 instances: no go, we miss the software configuration
- We moved the cluster to AWS EMR + spot instances + S3 storage

Can we do better?

- Pick ad-hoc cloud services (AWS Lambda e AWS Batch)
- ... to re-think the applications (food for thoughts)
