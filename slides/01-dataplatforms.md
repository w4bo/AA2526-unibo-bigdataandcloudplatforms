# How did we get here?

**Data-Driven Innovation**

- Use of data and _analytics_ to foster new products, processes, and markets
- Drive discovery and execution of innovation, achieving new services with a business value

**Analytics**

- A catch-all term for different business intelligence (BI) and application-related initiatives
  - E.g., analyzing information from a particular domain
  - E.g., applying BI capabilities to a specific content area (e.g., sales, service, supply chain)

**Advanced Analytics**

- (Semi-)Autonomous examination of data to discover deeper insights, make predictions, or generate recommendations (e.g., through data/text mining and machine learning)

**Augmented Analytics**

- Use of technologies such as machine learning and AI to assist with data preparation, insight generation, and insight explanation to augment how people explore and analyze data

# How did we get here?

![From descriptive to prescriptive analytics](img/slides6.png)

# Data platform

Companies are collecting tons of data to enable advanced analytics.

- Raw data is difficult to obtain, interpret, and maintain
- Data is more and more heterogeneous
- There is a need for curating data to make it _consumable_

Where are we _collecting/processing_ data?

- Getting _value_ from data _is not_ (only) a matter of _storage_
- Need integrated and multilevel analytical skills and techniques

# Data platform

> "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly, one begins to twist the facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."
>
> â€“ Sherlock Holmes

Getting _value_ from data _is not_ (only) a matter of _storage_

- Any example?

# Data platform

*Data lakes (or lakehouses)* have increasingly taken the role of *data hubs*

- Eliminate up-front costs of ingestion and ETL since data are stored in the original format
- Once in DL, data are available for analysis by everyone in the organization

*Drawing a sharp line between storage/computation/analysis is hard*

- Is a database just storage?
- What about SQL/OLAP?

*Blurring* of the *architectural borderlines*

- DL is often replaced by "data platform" or "data ecosystem"
- Encompass systems supporting data-intensive storage, computation, analysis

# Data platform

> **Data platform**
>
> A *unified* infrastructure that facilitates the ingestion, storage, management, and exploitation of large volumes of heterogeneous data. It provides a collection of *independent* and *well-integrated* services meeting *end-to-end* data needs.
>
> - *Unified*: is conceptually a data backbone
> - *Independent*: a service is not coupled with any other
> - *Well-integrated*: services have interfaces that enable easy and frictionless composition
> - *End-to-end*: services cover the entire data life cycle

Rationale: relieve users from the complexity of administration and provision

- Not only technological skills, but also privacy, access control, etc.
- Users should only focus on functional aspects

# Data platform

Are we done? No!

- Lacking smart support to govern the complexity of data and transformations
- Data transformations must be governed to prevent DP from turning into a swamp
  - Amplified in data science, with data scientists prevailing over data architects
  - Leverage descriptive metadata and maintenance to keep control over data

# Which functionalities for (automated) data management can you think about?

![Data governance](img/data-gov/dgvsds.jpg)

# Managing data platforms

- *Tracking data pipelines*: Data provenance
- *Tracking changes*: Data versioning
- *Saving storage*: Compression
- *Understanding the data*: Data profiling
- *Integrating data sources*: Entity resolution

- Every organization needs data governance since industries proceed on their digital-transformation journeys

A *data steward* is a role that ensures that data governance processes are followed and that guidelines are enforced, and recommends improvements to data governance processes.

Data profiling [@naumann2014data]

- A broad range of methods to efficiently analyze a given data set
- E.g., in a _relational_ scenario, _tables_ of a relational database are _scanned_ to derive _metadata_, such as _data types_, _completeness_ and _uniqueness_ of columns, _keys_ and  _foreign keys_, and occasionally _functional dependencies_ and _association rules_

# Data profiling

The results of data profiling are _computationally heavy_ to discover

- E.g., discovering keys/dependencies usually involves some sorting step for each considered column

... and we need to verify them _for groups of columns_ in a database

**Complexity**: given a table with four columns $\{w, x, y, z\}$, how many groups of columns?


| w | x | y | z |
|:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 1 | 2 | 1 | 4 |

![Powerset of four columns](img/lattice.svg)

:::
::::

- To extract the (distinct) cardinality of each column, I will consider $\binom{|C|}{1}=|C|$ columns $\{(w), (x), (y), (z)\}$
- To extract the correlations between pairs of columns, I will consider $\binom{|C|}{2}$ groups $\{(w, x), (w, y), (w, z), (x, y), ...\}$
- Extracting the relationships among all possible groups of columns generalizes to $\sum_{n=1}^{|C|}\binom{|C|}{n}=2^{|C|}âˆ’1$ groups
    - 3 columns â†’ 7 groups, 4 columns â†’ 15 groups, 5 columns â†’ 31 groups, 10 columns â†’ 1023 groups, ...

# Data profiling

Use cases

- _Query optimization_
  - Performed by DBMS to support query optimization with statistics about tables and columns
  - Profiling results can be used to estimate the selectivity of operators and the cost of a query plan
- _Data cleansing_ (typical use case is profiling data)
  - Prepare a cleansing process by revealing errors (e.g., in formatting), missing values, or outliers
- _Data integration and analytics_

# Data governance: data provenance

# Data provenance

> - Not only data products (e.g., tables, files), but also the processes that created them

:::{.fragment}
Examples of use cases [@simmhan2005survey]

- Business domain.
  - Users traditionally work with an _organized data schema_, where the structure and _semantics of the data in use are shared_ across the corporation or even B2B. Yet, a large proportion of businesses deal with _bad-quality data_. _Sources_ of bad data _need to be identified_ and corrected to avoid costly errors in business forecasting.
- Scientific/research domain.
  - _Data_ used in the scientific field can be _ad hoc_ and driven by _individual researchers_ or small communities. The scientific field is moving _towards more collaborative research_ and organizational boundaries are disappearing. _Sharing data and metadata across organizations is essential_, leading to convergence on common schemes to ensure compatibility. Issues of _trust_, _quality_, and _copyright_ of data are significant when using third-party data in such a loosely connected network.

# Data governance: meta-metadata management

# Data platform

Are we done? No!

- Metadata can become bigger than the data itself

We need meta meta-data (or models)...

- ... chasing our own tails

Data management is still a (research) issue in data platforms.

# Data platform {visibility="hidden"}

**Is it a Lakehouse with another name?**

- A Lakehouse is a part of the data platform, a layer that enables querying multiple data sources (with SQL/Spark) transparently by using some metadata (JSON) log
- Still, you could get a data platform where such transparency is not mandatory or could be achieved by different techniques (e.g., multistore [@forresi2021dataspace])

# Data platform {visibility="hidden"}

**Is it a new name for BI?**

No, in a data platform, you also need to manage (streams of) operational data and OLTP workloads.

# How do we build data platforms?

# Data fabric

**Data fabric** is a "vision for data management [...] that seamlessly connects different clouds, whether they are private or public environments." ([2016](https://cloud.netapp.com/hubfs/Data-Fabric/Data%20Fabric%20WP%20April%202017.pdf))

Frictionless access and sharing of data in a distributed data environment

- Enables a *single and consistent data management framework*
- *Continuously identifies and connects data* from disparate applications to discover unique business-relevant relationships

It is a unified architecture with an integrated set of technologies and services.

- Designed to deliver integrated and enriched data at the right time, in the right method, and to the right data consumer
- Combines key data management technologies such as *data governance*, *integration*, *pipelining*, and *orchestration*

# Data fabric: example from Cloudera

![Cloudera SDX](img/CDP-diagram-sm.png)

# Data fabric

* *Catalog all data*: Cover business glossary, design-time, and runtime metadata.
* *Enable self-service capabilities*: Support data discovery, profiling, exploration, quality checks, and consumption.
* *Provide a knowledge graph*: Visualize links among data, people, processes, and systems for actionable insight.
* *Deliver automatic integration*: Help IT and business users with data integration, transformation, virtualization, and federation.
* *Manage unified lifecycle*: Maintain a consistent end-to-end Data Fabric lifecycle across platforms and teams.

# Data fabric

**It is a design concept**

- It optimizes data management by automating repetitive tasks
- According to Gartner estimates, 25% of data management vendors will provide a complete framework for data fabric by 2024 â€“ up from 5% today

**Active metadata** is a way of managing metadata that leverages open APIs to connect all services in your data platform.

*Active metadata is always on*

- Automatically and continually collect metadata from various sources and data flows â€” logs, query history, usage statistics.

*Active metadata is "intelligent"*:

- Constantly process metadata to connect the dots and create intelligence from it.
- E.g., auto-classify sensitive data, automatic suggestions to document a data asset's description.

*Active metadata is action-oriented*

- Active metadata should drive actions such as curating recommendations and generating alerts

*Active metadata is open by default*

- Use APIs to hook into every piece of the data platform.

# Data mesh

Distributed data architecture under centralized governance and standardization for interoperability, enabled by a shared and harmonized self-serve data infrastructure

- *Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership*
  - Decentralization and distribution of responsibility to people who are closest to the data, to support continuous change and scalability
  - Each domain exposes its own op/analytical APIs
- **Data as a product** (_quantum_)
  - Products must be discoverable, addressable, trustworthy, self-describing, and secure
- *Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform*
  - High-level abstraction of infrastructure to provision and manage the lifecycle of data products
- *Federated computational governance*
  - A governance model that embraces decentralization and domain self-sovereignty, interoperability through global standardization, a dynamic topology, and automated execution of decisions by the platform

# Data mesh

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

Data Mesh organizes data around **business domain owners** and transforms relevant data assets (data sources) to **data products** that can be consumed by distributed business users from various business domains or functions.

- Data products are created, governed, and used in an **autonomous, decentralized**, and self-service manner
- **Self-service capabilities**, which we have already referenced as a Data Fabric capability, enable business organizations to entertain a data marketplace with shopping-for-data characteristics

# What makes data a product?

A **data product** is raw data transformed into a business context

- Data products are registered in the **knowledge catalog** through specifications (XML, JSON, etc.).
- Data products need to be searchable and discoverable by potential data product consumers and business users.
  - *Cataloged*: All data products need to be registered in the knowledge catalog.
  - *Data product description*: The data product needs to be well-described.
  - *Access methods*: for example, REST APIs, SQL, NoSQL, etc., and where to find the data asset.
  - *Policies and rules*: who is allowed to consume the data product for what purpose.
  - *SLAs*: agreements regarding the data product availability, performance characteristics, functions, and cost of data product usage.
- Data products themselves are not stored in the knowledge catalog

# Data mesh vs data fabric

They are design concepts, not things.

- They are not mutually exclusive
- They are architectural frameworks, not architectures
  - The frameworks must be adapted and customized to your needs, data, processes, and terminology
  - Gartner estimates 25% of data management vendors will provide a complete data fabric solution by 2024 â€“ up from 5% today

# Data mesh vs data fabric

Both provide an architectural framework to access data across multiple technologies and platforms.

**Data fabric**

- Attempts to centralize and coordinate data management
- Tackles the complexity of data and metadata in a smart way that works well together
- Focus on the architectural, technical capabilities, and intelligent analysis to produce active metadata supporting a smarter, AI-infused system to orchestrate various data integration styles

**Data mesh**

- Emphasis on decentralization and data domain autonomy
- Focuses on organizational change; it is more about people and process
- Data are primarily organized around domain owners who create business-focused data products, which can be aggregated and consumed across distributed consumers

# Data mesh vs data fabric

Data Fabric and Mesh are the results of the data architecture evolution.

- **Many capabilities were in existence already long before** the terms were coined

Takeaway:

- Abstract the "building blocks" of such platforms
- Let them evolve according to scalability and flexibility requirements

# Example of data platform: Hadoop-based

A data platform on the Hadoop stack requires several tools.

![Hadoop-based data platform](img/74.svg)

How many levels of complexity are hidden here?

How do you provision it?

- Manual provisioning on-premises
- Semi-automatic provisioning on-premises
- Automatic provisioning in the cloud

# On-premises manual provisioning

It is hardly advisable, if not for small and local tests.

**Technical challenges**
- Installation: how do I set up a new machine?
- Networking: how do I cable dozens of machines?
- Management: how do I replace a broken disk?
- Upgrade: how do I extend the cluster with new services/machines?
- (energy and cooling, software licenses, insurance...)

**Technological challenges**

- How do we configure a distributed environment?
- How do we set up/integrate/control independent services?
- How do we orchestrate data flows?

**Business challenges**

- Can we afford to spend resources on tasks that are not mission-oriented?
- No free lunch, each choice has a cost/benefit
- How much time does it take to master a technology?
- How many people do I need?

# Summing up

Storage should be flexible enough to support heterogeneous data models and raw data.

- From operational databases to DWHs **(why?)**
- From relational data models to NoSQL **(why?)**
- Data lake to (directly) ingest raw data

Storage,  _per se_, is insufficient to get value from the data **(examples?)**

- We also need data processing and fruition
- Data lakes are blurring into data platforms

Data platforms support end-to-end data needs **(which ones?)**

- Building data platforms is hard **(why?)**
- Managing data platforms is hard; exploit metadata to ease this task
- Data lineage, compression, profiling, resolution, etc.

**Open question**: How do we deploy working data platforms?
