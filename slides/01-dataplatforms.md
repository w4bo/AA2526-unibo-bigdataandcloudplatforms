# How did we get here?

**Data-Driven Innovation**

- Use of data and _analytics_ to foster new products, processes, and markets
- Drive discovery and execution of innovation, achieving new services with a business value

**Analytics**

- A catch-all term for different business intelligence (BI)- and application-related initiatives
  - E.g., analyzing information from a particular domain
  - E.g., applying BI capabilities to a specific content area (e.g., sales, service, supply chain)

**Advanced Analytics**

- (Semi-)Autonomous examination of data to discover deeper insights, make predictions, or generate recommendations (e.g., through data/text mining and machine learning)

**Augmented Analytics**

- Use of technologies such as machine learning and AI to assist with data preparation, insight generation, and insight explanation to augment how people explore and analyze data

# How did we get here?

![From descriptive to prescriptive analytics](imgs/slides6.png)

# Data platform

Companies are collecting tons of data to enable advanced analytics

- Raw data is difficult to obtain, interpret, and maintain
- Data is more and more heterogeneous
- There is a need for curating data to make it _consumable_

Where are we _collecting/processing_ data?

- Getting _value_ from data _is not_ (only) a matter of _storage_
- Need integrated and multilevel analytical skills and techniques

# Data platform

> "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly, one begins to twist the facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."
>
> â€“ Sherlock Holmes

Getting _value_ from data _is not_ (only) a matter of _storage_

- Any example?

# Data platform

Data lakes (or lakehouses) have increasingly taken the role of data hubs

- Eliminate up-front costs of ingestion and ETL since data are stored in original format
- Once in DL, data are available for analysis by everyone in the organization

Drawing a sharp line between storage/computation/analysis is hard

- Is a database just storage?
- What about SQL/OLAP?

Blurring of the architectural borderlines

- DL is often replaced by "data platform" or "data ecosystem"
- Encompass systems supporting data-intensive storage, computation, analysis

# Data platform

A data platform is a **centralized** infrastructure that facilitates the ingestion, storage, management, and exploitation of large volumes of heterogeneous data. It provides a collection of **independent** and **well-integrated** services meeting **end-to-end** data needs.

- **Centralized**: is conceptually a single and unified component
- **Independent**: a service is not coupled with any other
- **Well-integrated**: services have interfaces that enable easy and frictionless composition
- **End-to-end**: services cover the entire data life cycle

Rationale: relieve users from the complexity of administration and provision

- Not only technological skills but also privacy, access control, etc.
- Users should only focus on functional aspects

# Data platform

Are we done? No!

- Lacking smart support to govern the complexity of data and transformations
- Data transformations must be governed to prevent DP from turning into a swamp
  - Amplified in data science, with data scientists prevailing data architects
  - Leverage descriptive metadata and maintenance to keep control over data

# Which functionalities for (automated) data management can you think about?

# Managing data platforms

- Tracking data pipelines: Data provenance
- Tracking changes: Data versioning
- Saving storage: Compression
- Understanding the data: Data profiling
- Integrating data sources: Entity resolution
- ...

# Data governance

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}

**Data governance** is everything you do to ensure data is secure, private, accurate, available, and usable

- It includes the actions people must take, the processes they must follow, and the technology that supports them throughout the data life cycle
- Every organization needs data governance since industries proceed on their digital-transformation journeys

A *data steward* is a role that ensures that data governance processes are followed and that guidelines are enforced, and recommends improvements to data governance processes.

# Data provenance

Provenance (also referred to as lineage, pedigree, parentage, genealogy)

- The description of the origins of data and the process by which it arrived at the database
- Not only data products (e.g., tables, files), but also the processes that created them

Examples of use cases [@simmhan2005survey]

- Business domain.
  - Users traditionally work with an _organized data schema_, where the structure and _semantics of the data in use are shared_ across the corporation or even B2B. Yet, a large proportion of businesses deal with _bad-quality data_. _Sources_ of bad data _need to be identified_ and corrected to avoid costly errors in business forecasting.
- Scientific/research domain.
  - _Data_ used in the scientific field can be _ad hoc_ and driven by _individual researchers_ or small communities. The scientific field is moving _towards more collaborative research_ and organizational boundaries are disappearing. _Sharing data and metadata across organizations is essential_, leading to convergence on common schemes to ensure compatibility. Issues of _trust_, _quality_, and _copyright_ of data are significant when using third-party data in such a loosely connected network.

Astronomers are creating an international Virtual Observatory

- A _federation_ of all the world significant astronomical _data resources_ coupled with _provision of the computational resources_ needed to exploit the data scientifically
- Astronomy changed from being an individualistic to a _collective enterprise_
- Telescope time is devoted/allocated to systematic sky surveys and analysis is performed using data from the archives
- Astronomers are _increasingly relying on data that they did not take themselves_
- Raw data bear _many instrumental signatures that must be removed_ in the process of generating data products [@mann2002some]

# Data provenance

Granularity [@simmhan2005survey]

- _Fine-grained_ (instance level): tracking data items (e.g., a tuple in a dataset) transformations
- _Coarse-grained_ (schema-level): tracking dataset transformations

Queries [@ikeda2009data]

- _Where_ provenance: given some output, which inputs did the output come from?
- _How_ provenance: given some output, how were the inputs manipulated?
- _Why_ provenance: given some output, why was data generated?
  - E.g., in the form of a proof tree that locates source data items contributing to its creation

# Data provenance

# Data profiling

Use cases

- _Query optimization_
  - Performed by DBMS to support query optimization with statistics about tables and columns
  - Profiling results can be used to estimate the selectivity of operators and the cost of a query plan
- _Data cleansing _ (typical use case is profiling data)
  - Prepare a cleansing process by revealing errors (e.g., in formatting), missing values, or outliers
- _Data integration and analytics_

Challenges?

# Data profiling

The results of data profiling are _computationally heavy_ to discover

- E.g., discovering keys/dependencies usually involves some sorting step for each considered column

- Still, you could get a data platform where such transparency is not mandatory or could be achieved by different techniques (e.g., multistore [@forresi2021dataspace])

# Data platform

**Is it a new name for BI?**

No, in a data platform, you also need to manage (streams of) operational data and OLTP workloads

# How do we build data platforms?

# Data fabric

**Data fabric** is a "vision for data management [...] that seamlessly connects different clouds, whether they are private, public, or hybrid environments." ([2016](https://cloud.netapp.com/hubfs/Data-Fabric/Data%20Fabric%20WP%20April%202017.pdf))

Frictionless access and sharing of data in a distributed data environment

- Enables a *single and consistent data management framework*
- ... that allows *seamless data access and processing* by design across otherwise siloed storage
- Leverages *human and machine capabilities to access data* in place or support its consolidation where appropriate
- *Continuously identifies and connects data* from disparate applications to discover unique business-relevant relationships

It is a unified architecture with an integrated set of technologies and services

- Designed to deliver integrated and enriched data at the right time, in the right method, and to the right data consumer
- Combines key data management technologies such as *data governance*, *integration*, *pipelining*, and *orchestration*

**Active metadata** is a way of managing metadata that leverages open APIs to connect all services in your data platform and ferry metadata back and forth.

*Active metadata is always on*

- Automatically and continually collect metadata from various sources and steps of data flow â€” logs, query history, usage statistics.

*Active metadata is "intelligent"*: 

- Constantly process metadata to connect the dots and create intelligence from it.
- E.g., auto-classify sensitive data, automatic suggestions to document a data asset's description, send alerts about critical issues.

*Active metadata is action-oriented*

- Active metadata should drive actions such as curating recommendations and generating alerts

*Active metadata is open by default*

- Active metadata use APIs to hook into every piece of the data platform.

# Data mesh

Distributed data architecture, under centralized governance and standardization for interoperability, enabled by a shared and harmonized self-serve data infrastructure

- *Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership*
  - Decentralization and distribution of responsibility to people who are closest to the data, in order to support continuous change and scalability
  - Each domain exposes its own op/analytical APIs
- **Data as a product** (_quantum_)
  - Products must be discoverable, addressable, trustworthy, self-describing, secure
- *Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform*
  - High-level abstraction of infrastructure to provision and manage the lifecycle of data products
- *Federated computational governance*
  - A governance model that embraces decentralization and domain self-sovereignty, interoperability through global standardization, a dynamic topology, automated execution of decisions by the platform

# Data mesh

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

Data Mesh organizes data around **business domain owners** and transforms relevant data assets (data sources) to **data products** that can be consumed by distributed business users from various business domains or functions

- Data products are created, governed, and used in an **autonomous, decentralized**, and self-service manner
- **Self-service capabilities**, which we have already referenced as a Data Fabric capability, enable business organizations to entertain a data marketplace with shopping-for-data characteristics

# What makes data a product?

A **data product** is raw data transformed into a business context

- Data products are registered in **knowledge catalog ** through specifications (XML, JSON, etc.)
- Main features
  - *Data product description*: The data product needs to be well-described
  - *Access methods*: for example, REST APIs, SQL, NoSQL, etc., and where to find the data asset
  - *Policies and rules*: who is allowed to consume the data product for what purpose
  - *SLAs*: agreements regarding the data product availability, performance characteristics, functions, cost of data product usage
  - *Defined format*: A data product needs to be described using a defined format
  - *Cataloged*: All data products need to be registered in the knowledge catalog. Data products need to be searchable and discoverable by potential data product consumers and business user
- Data products themselves are not stored in the knowledge catalog

# Data mesh vs data fabric

They are design concepts, not things

- They are not mutually exclusive
- They are architectural frameworks, not architectures
  - The frameworks must be adapted and customized to your needs, data, processes, and terminology
  - Gartner estimates 25% of data management vendors will provide a complete data fabric solution by 2024 â€“ up from 5% today

# Data mesh vs data fabric

Both provide an architectural framework to access data across multiple technologies and platforms

- **Data fabric**
  - Attempts to centralize and coordinate data management
  - Tackles the complexity of data and metadata in a smart way that works well together
  - Focus on the architectural, technical capabilities, and intelligent analysis to produce active metadata supporting a smarter, AI-infused system to orchestrate various data integration styles
- **Data mesh**
  - Emphasis on decentralization and data domain autonomy
  - Focuses on organizational change; it is more about people and process
  - Data are primarily organized around domain owners who create business-focused data products, which can be aggregated and consumed across distributed consumers

# Data mesh vs data fabric

Data Fabric and Mesh are the results of the data architecture evolution

- **Many capabilities were in existence already long before** the terms were coined

Take away:

- Abstract the "building blocks" of such platforms
- Let them evolve according to scalability and flexibility requirements

How many levels of complexity are hidden here?

How do you provision it?

- Manual provisioning on-premises
- Semi-automatic provisioning on-premises
- Automatic provisioning in the cloud

# On-premises manual provisioning

It is hardly advisable, if not for small and local tests

- **Technical challenges**
  - Installation: how do I set up a new machine?
  - Networking: how do I cable dozens of machines?
  - Management: how do I replace a broken disk?
  - Upgrade: how do I extend the cluster with new services/machines?
  - (energy and cooling, software licenses, insurance...)
- **Technological challenges**
  - How do we configure a distributed environment?
  - How do we set up/integrate/control independent services?
  - How do we orchestrate data flows?
- **Business challenges**
  - Can we afford to spend resources on tasks that are not mission-oriented?
  - No free lunch, each choice has a cost/benefit
  - How much time does it take to master a technology?
  - How many people do I need?

# Summing up

- Storage should be flexible enough to support heterogenous data models and raw data
  - From operational databases to DWHs **(why?)**
  - From relational data models to NoSQL **(why?)**
  - Data lake to (directly) ingest raw data
- Storage,  _per se_, is insufficient to get value from the data **(examples?)**
  - We also need data processing and fruition
  - Data lakes are blurring into data platforms
- Data platforms support end-to-end data needs **(which ones?)**
  - Building data platforms is hard **(why?)**
  - Managing data platforms is hard, exploit meta-data to ease this task
    - Data lineage, compression, profiling, resolution, etc.
- **Open question**: how do we deploy working data platforms?
